### BASIC DATA EXPLORATION WITH PANDA ON BIKESHARE DATA
*A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data*

##### AUTHOR - [MOJISOLA PETERS](https://github.com/Naomi-mjay) Mentioned all the help received in 'Credits' section

### Description
In this project, we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### How to run the program
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program.

### Requirements
* Language: Python 3.6 or above
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

### Files used
chicago.csv - The chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

### Credits
**Udacity** - Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
